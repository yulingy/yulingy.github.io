Starting Aug 2024, I am an assistant professor in the [https://stat.wisc.edu Department of Statistics] at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Previously, I spent one year as a Norbert Wiener Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, working with Professor [https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/ Philippe Rigollet] and Professor [https://wainwrigwork.github.io/ Martin Wainwright]. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Princeton University in 2023, advised by Professor [https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/index.html Yuxin Chen] and Professor [https://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/ Jianqing Fan]. I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2018.\n
