I am a Norbert Wiener Postdoctoral Associate in the [https://idss.mit.edu Institute for Data, Systems and Society (IDSS)] at MIT, mentored by Professor [https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/ Philippe Rigollet] and Professor [https://wainwrigwork.github.io/ Martin Wainwright]. I am also affiliated to the [https://lids.mit.edu Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)]. 

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Princeton University in 2023, advised by Professor [https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/index.html Yuxin Chen] and Professor [https://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/ Jianqing Fan]. I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2018.\n

I will join [https://stat.wisc.edu Department of Statistics] at University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in Fall 2024.

*Research interests*: statistics, mathematics of data science, and their applications to AI and social sciences. \n
